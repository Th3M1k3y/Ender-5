## IDEX addon

This mount will easily make you able to mount the idex addon board inside the controller cabinet on an Ender 5 Pro.

You will need 3 pcs M3 screws to hold the PCB to the mount, to mount it in the cabinet you just slide it over two of the standoffs for the controller PCB.

Make sure to route the flat flex cable so it won't get pinched by the pins on the bottom of the controller PCB.
